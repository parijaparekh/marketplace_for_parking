## Rentabay is a parking spot booking web app created by Parija Parekh Sidney Mak And myself Tyson Jackson. This app is our 2nd prokect of our UWA coding course, it is an app that allows users to lease out their own parking spaces at their house for other user to book out for money . We decided to go for this as it give people that struggle to afford parking or find it hard to find a park able to get a cheap and close parking spot to their destination. It also gives seller a chance to make more money in this increasingly dificult time of interest rate hikes.
